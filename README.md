# Command_Line_Snake
snake in the windows command line

it is 12 am right now and i still havent refactored anything. ill do it when i wakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkke up i think

i made this because im procrastinating on learning sdl, and gui stuff in general. I like the console. its like a peice of paper. It doesn't appear to be able to do that much at first glance, but it caan actually be used to make beauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutiful art. you know the hardest part was figuring out how to make the snakes body actually appear behind the snakes head correctly. That was pretty much the only hard part i think. I feel drunk, but im too young to drink. maybe its because of spongebob. I heard hes been doing some baaaaad things lately and i think its rubbinh off on me a bit.

Im sorry. Im trying to be a better person but i dont know how. I can't forget about those past mistakes, but i can learn from them, and move forward. I wont ever get to say sorry to you for what i did, but I think that the tbest i can do is try to be better from now on.






I like uno. its a fun game. Also you remember Olivia from middle school? what hhe fucl happen to her? I miss her? what?

Yopu know, when you look at everything with rose coloured glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.

I came up with the quote, "the moon shines brightest among the darkest nights", but a few weeks later i find "the stars shine brightest in the darkest night" or something around those lines. Now, if i try to tell someone i made up that quote, since it was already a thing, they wont believe me! I hate that, but what can you do?

C++ is a fun little thng i think. Its like c# but better
